EARLY DETECTION OF BASAL BULB ROT DISEASE IN SHALLOTS USING IOT &amp; MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS 

Basal rot is a serious fungal disease affecting crops such as onions, garlic, and other root vegetables, often resulting in significant yield losses. This study proposes an integrated early detection system utilizing the ESP32-CAM module to capture real-time images of plant roots and basal regions, combined with a pH sensor for continuous soil acidity monitoring—an important factor influencing fungal growth. Image processing techniques are applied to detect visible symptoms of infection, such as discoloration and tissue decay, while pH variations serve as supplementary indicators of disease susceptibility. The integration of vision-based analysis with soil parameter monitoring enables more accurate and timely identification of basal rot, offering a proactive approach to crop protection and sustainable agricultural practices. 

The data collection process involved capturing real-time images of shallot plants at various stages of basal bulb rot infection. Using the ESP32-CAM module deployed in a natural agricultural environment, a dataset comprising 2,000 images was gathered over a monitoring period of 45 days. Each image was labeled manually based on visual signs of infection, including discoloration, basal softening, and decay, to ensure accurate ground truth for model training. Simultaneously, corresponding soil pH readings were recorded using the pH sensor, enabling the integration of both visual and environmental parameters for improved disease prediction.
he collected dataset was split into training and testing sets using an 80:20 ratio. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on the MobileNetV2 architecture was trained on the image data, achieving a training accuracy of 96.8% and a validation accuracy of 92.3%. In parallel, the Random Forest classifier trained on soil pH features attained a classification accuracy of 88.5% on the test set. After implementing the late fusion strategy that combined predictions from both models, the system achieved an overall detection accuracy of 93.7% for identifying infected plants as illustrated in Figure 2: Accuracy of Basal Bulb Rot Detection Using Late Fusion Model. The confusion matrix analysis indicated high sensitivity (recall) of 94.1% for infected samples and specificity of 92.8% for healthy samples, highlighting the model’s effectiveness in early disease detection while minimizing false positives.
