EARLY DETECTION OF BASAL BULB ROT DISEASE IN SHALLOTS USING IOT &amp; MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS 

Basal rot is a serious fungal disease affecting crops such as onions, garlic, and other root vegetables, often resulting in significant yield losses. This study proposes an integrated early detection system utilizing the ESP32-CAM module to capture real-time images of plant roots and basal regions, combined with a pH sensor for continuous soil acidity monitoringâ€”an important factor influencing fungal growth. Image processing techniques are applied to detect visible symptoms of infection, such as discoloration and tissue decay, while pH variations serve as supplementary indicators of disease susceptibility. The integration of vision-based analysis with soil parameter monitoring enables more accurate and timely identification of basal rot, offering a proactive approach to crop protection and sustainable agricultural practices.
